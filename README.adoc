= Ansible Sandbox with docker

== Principles
* Ansible Sandbox
* Only requirements: docker and docker-compose
* Choice of ansible version
* Ansible uses docker socket to connect to targetted containers
* A shared dir is mounted as volume

== Tested on
* Windows with docker desktop
* Ubuntu

== Startup
* Build docker image
** docker build -t
* Startup docker-compose
** docker-compose up -d


== Connect other containers
* Use inventory
** Fil it with **container names**
** Warning:

== Ansible docker image
* docker needs to be installed
* community.docker
